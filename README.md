# A-COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS-OF-CNN-ARCHITECTURES-IN-IDENTIFYING-TOMATO-FOLIAR-DISEASE
The proponents compared the accuracy of LeNet-5 and MobileNetV2 convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and we propose an improved version of LeNet-5 architecture for classifying ten different tomato foliar diseases. The results shown that the proposed improved LeNet-5 model demonstrated a significant improvement on accuracy in contrast to the original architecture and MobileNetV2.
